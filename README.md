## 🤓 About Me

Hi There! 🖖

I'm [Nicola](https://nicola.xyz) and I love to define myself a Hybrid Hacker. 

What is a Hybrid Hacker? A Hybrid Hacker can be thought of as a "Swiss Army Knife" of problem-solving. They possess a diverse set of skills, ranging from technical expertise to creative thinking and building useful things.

Here on Github I share the code I use to solve various problems, to automate things (I love that a lot) or simply for fun and learning purposes.
