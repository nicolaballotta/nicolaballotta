Hi There! :space_invader:

I'm [Nicola](https://nicola.xyz) and I love to define myself an Hybrid Hacker. 

What is a Hybrid Hacker? A Hybrid Hacker can be thought of as a "Swiss Army Knife" of problem-solving. They possess a diverse set of skills, ranging from technical expertise to creative thinking and building useful things.

Here on Github I share the code I use to solve various problems, to automate things (I love that a lot) or simply for fun and learning purposes.

If you want to know more about me:

- You can subscribe to [The Hybrid Hacker](https://hybridhacker.email), my brand new newsletter
- You can check my [Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolaballotta/)
- As a last resort, you can give a look to [my blog](https://hybridhacker.com), but it's far from being an active blog!
